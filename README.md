The file "app_wotData.py", is the file that we need for create the .exe file of the app.
Why we dont use the file "app.py"? Because the PyInstaller has a problem with the lib numpy, so in that case, at the moment, we just have in mind to run only 
the code of the simulation, if you want to create a exe file, all the code is in the "Crecimeinto_Celular.ipynb" file.
